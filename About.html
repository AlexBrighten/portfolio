                <h1 class="title1">What made me a UI/UX designer</h1>
                <h3 class="subtitle">
                    My interest in design sparked during my early teens, inspired by designers I met at my church. I fell in
                    love with designing and started practicing whenever the designers weren&#x27;t around. One day, I got the
                    chance to design a YouTube thumbnail because they needed extra help, and that experience changed everything
                    for me.<br /><br />When I got to college, I learned about UI/UX designing. Because I enjoyed designing so
            much, I decided to focus on learning UI/UX design. This caught the attention of my teachers, and they chose
            me to design a website for an event called TECHUTSAV. Working on that project gave me a lot of
            experience.<br /><br />Later on, I was given another big opportunity to contribute to a major project at SRM
            University. These experiences made me even more passionate about UI/UX design and inspired me to keep
            learning.

                <h1 class="title11">Why UI/UX designing ?</h1>
                <h3 class="subtitle1">
                    In the past, coding was my jam! I loved figuring out puzzles with programming languages and building things
                    with code. But then I stumbled upon the world of UI/UX design, and it was like a match made in heaven. It
                    turns out, UI/UX design lets me use my creative side for design, while also keeping some of that technical
                    problem-solving I enjoy. It was like finding a way to combine my two passions into one awesome career path.
                    So, I decided to ditch the pure software engineer route and dive head first into the world of UI/UX design!

                <h1 class="title12">Beyond UI/UX: What Else Ignites My Creativity?</h1>
                <h3 class="subtitle11">
                    In addition to loving UI/UX design, I get a kick out of planning events! It all started in high school as a
                    student leader, where I organized stuff. That experience made me love event planning, and it came in handy
                    later in college when I helped out with a huge national event called Techutsav. I&#x27;m good at staying
                    calm under pressure, so even when things get crazy, I can handle it. But wait, there&#x27;s more! I also
                    dabble in photography. I took pictures at another national event, Milan, and even designed some social media
                    posts for them.

                <h2 class="medium_title2">
                    Moving forward, I want to collaborate with other designers to create intuitive digital experiences that give
                    all users confidence and delight.
