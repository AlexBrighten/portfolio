                >Researchers can&#x27;t easily find other researchers who have the skills they need to work on their
                projects together.<br /></span><span class="subtitle_span5"></span><span class="subtitle_span6">Tracking research is messy: </span><span class="subtitle_span7">
                The university doesn&#x27;t have a good system for keeping track of how many projects researchers are
                finishing or how many papers they&#x27;re publishing.<br /></span><span class="subtitle_span8"></span><span class="subtitle_span9">Talking to each other is difficult: </span><span class="subtitle_span10"> </span><span class="subtitle_span11"
                >Researchers don&#x27;t have a good way to connect with each other and share what they&#x27;re working
                on, which makes it hard to find people to help with their projects.  This is especially true for
                projects that need people with different backgrounds.<br /></span><span class="subtitle_span12"
                >Because SRM is such a big university, these problems are even worse. Researchers are spread out in
                different departments, so it&#x27;s even harder for them to find the right people to work with.  This
                can slow down research and make it harder for researchers to come up with new ideas.</span></span>

                face in finding collaborators, tracking research activity, and fostering communication.<br />Here&#x27;s
                a breakdown of how this platform tackles these issues:<br /></span><span class="subtitle1_span1">Connecting Researchers:</span><span class="subtitle1_span2"> </span><span class="subtitle1_span3"
                >The platform will provide a central hub for researchers to showcase their expertise and pitch their
                research ideas. This will allow for easy discovery of potential collaborators with complementary skills,
                facilitating team formation.</span><span class="subtitle1_span4"><br /></span><span class="subtitle1_span5">Enhanced Visibility:</span><span class="subtitle1_span6"> </span><span class="subtitle1_span7"
                >By centralizing research activity on the platform, we aim to gain a clearer picture of ongoing projects
                and publications at SRM. This transparency will not only benefit researchers seeking collaborators but
                also provide valuable insights for the university as a whole.</span><span class="subtitle1_span8"><br /></span><span class="subtitle1_span9">Building a Collaborative Network:</span><span class="subtitle1_span10"> </span><span class="subtitle1_span11"
                >We&#x27;re integrating features that encourage communication and collaboration among researchers. This
                could include discussion forums, project management tools, and functionalities to directly connect with
                relevant faculty members.</span><span class="subtitle1_span12"
                ><br />We believe this platform will be a game-changer for research at SRM University. It will empower
                researchers to connect seamlessly, streamline research processes, and ultimately propel the university
                towards achieving even greater research success.</span></span>

                <h3 class="subtitle11">
                    <br />Dream Teams Made Easy: Researchers will find collaborators faster, forming stronger research teams.<br />Smoother
            Sailing, Faster Finish: Collaboration tools and progress tracking will streamline research and lead to more
            projects reaching the finish line.<br />Sharing is Caring, Publishing is Booming: Researchers will connect
            and share ideas, potentially leading to more published research papers.<br />Research on Rocket Fuel:
            Overall research productivity will soar, boosting SRM&#x27;s reputation and attracting top talent.

                    <h3 class="subtitle12">
                        Design Principles: I learned how to apply design principles to create a user-friendly interface (e.g.,
                        using hierarchy to prioritize information and white space to improve readability).<br /><br />Figma Tools:
              I mastered using Figma&#x27;s prototyping features to effectively communicate user interactions and user
              flows within my design.<br /><br />User Psychology: By considering the concept of cognitive load, I was
              able to design a more intuitive experience by minimizing complexity and presenting information in a clear
              and concise manner.<br /><br />User Experience (UX):  This project broadened my understanding of UX
              principles, allowing me to design an interface that not only looks good but also caters to the user&#x27;s
              needs and expectations throughout their interaction.
